# BridgeLabz Java Full Stack Training Repository 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the BridgeLabz Java Full Stack Development with Angular, Python, and GenAI program! 📚 This repo tracks my hands-on progress through the 21-week curriculum, including prerequisite setups, core programming, OOP, DSA, collections, and beyond. Code is organized by branches aligned with weekly modules, featuring completed assignments from GCR codebases, scenario-based problems, and practice submissions. 💻

The structure follows BridgeLabz guidelines: daily practices, lab submissions, and problem-solving approaches in Java. All work uses standard tools like Git Bash, Notepad++, JDK, and Eclipse 🛠️

**Current Progress**: As of January 3, 2026, Weeks 1-3 are completed (assignments submitted) ✅, Week 4 is in progress (Generics submission due today) 🔄.

To get started:
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/VaidikPandey/BridgeLabz-Training.git` 📥
2. Checkout branch: `git checkout <branch-name>` 🔀
3. Open in IDE, compile: `javac *.java`, run: `java <ClassName>` ▶️

**Branch**: `main` (setup files and initial README). 🏠
